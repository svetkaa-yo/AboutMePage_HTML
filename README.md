<p> During my courses, I gained hands-on experience in web development. I learned how to structure web pages using HTML, style them with CSS to create visually appealing layouts. I worked with Visual Studio Code as my primary development environment. For my website, I initially used Bootstrap as a starting point due to its responsive grid system and pre-built components. However, I customized the template extensively to better align with my specific design and requirements.
